Data Science is hacking, stats, and domain knowledge.
I. Why data science
  The growth of data in the world, and because of this companies have lots of data.  However, they don't know how to make use of this data - and they have this intuition that with tools available they can extract insight and become a data drive company.

  Over the last few years, companies have already begun doing this.  For example:
    Health Care...
    Using data, they have been able to do this.
    But sometimes it goes wrong...

    Eg. Almost killed people useing this.


  So to extract insight, and use data in the correct way we need three skills.

  • Hacking skills, math/stats, and domain
    1. Hacking -
      □ Can write code to get the data wherever it is, in it's rawest form
      □ Can manipulate, and explore the data
      □ Can use python libraries - to run analysis
      □ Most important: can deliver the results in a small web app or the equivalent
      □ And this all involves writing python code
    2. Stats
      □ Even if you can write the python code, you can do some stupid stuff with models if you don't understand the math/stats knowledge
      1. How do you frame the problem
        ® How do you gather what the customer/you want to do to then
        A) Gather the correct data
        B) Place it in the correct format
        C) And run it through the correct type of model
        D) To answer your question
      □ So then knowing what technique to use, sci-kit learn has many techniques in there
      □ How to evaluate and validate different modeling strategies
      □



    1. Domain knowledge  - Business Analytics
      □ Understand the business problem you are trying to solve
      □ And really knowing the data
        ® If it has 100 variables, will understand how it was stored originally, how was extracted, how transformed it before got to the model
        ® How is it behaving inside of the model
        ® How will it be operationalized -> what will the impact be for someone non-technical
        ® How will you communicate the value to someone who does not understand the details of what you are doing
I. Opportunities
  1. Better infrastructure and tools
    § Python has some scaling problems
  2. Use cases that can be solved with machine learning
    § I wish that was automated
    § Health - drug discovery for better medicines, or trying to see if likely to develop something; quantified self -> what is inside your body to say before something goes wrong
    § Internet of things - machine data, etc
    § Education -> intelligent learning platforms that adjust questions to them
    § Computer vision ->
  3. Data Science Services
    § Lots of companies with lots of money who are bad at data scientists
    § Bc Phd statisticians, and nothing comes out of this
    § Why this is hard is bc they don't have software engineering skills, and implementing the model and having it affect  the business, they cannot do it
  ○ Become a generalized data scientist
    § Can go to any domain - drug discovery, sports, ask the right questions and understand the domain enough to execute on the data science
II. Questions
  ○ What do you want -> where to be 5 years from now?
  ○ What will you do about it?

• What's the best model I can build
• Random Forest, Boosted Trees, SVMs, regularized generalized linear models, decision trees for exploring the data
